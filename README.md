# research-thesis-master-phd-ideas
List of research ideas that could be addressed by me in the future or just do it on your end.


## Ideas
1. [GraphQL Go â€” implementation and compatibility validation](https://github.com/chris-ramon/thesis-graphql-go).
2. GraphQL implementator and compatibility validator.
3. Gain understanding, standard compatibility, benchmarks, adoption and end-users apis developer experience of the different GraphQL implementations in the Go programming language, so compatibility against the reference implementation, benchmarks, adoption and API usefulness.
4. Gain understanding of the benefits to auto-create UI dashboards by programatically defining it using the Go programing language, so using the findings to produce a software library.
